# EDA-and-Hypothesis-testing-on-Health-insurance-cost
This project aims to analyze health insurance charges such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. Through statistical hypothesis testing, feature engineering, and advanced visualization techniques, I will try to uncover data patterns and test the statements or assumptions about the data through EDA and Hypothesis Testing.
